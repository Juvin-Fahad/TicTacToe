# üéÆ TicTacToe Game in Java

A simple terminal-based **TicTacToe** game written in Java using basic object-oriented programming principles.

## üìã Features

- Two-player game (Player X and Player O)
- Menu-driven start: choose to play or exit
- Option to play multiple rounds
- Input validation for start menu
- Console-based user interface

## üß† How It Works

- When you run the program, it prompts you to:
  - Press `1` to **start playing**
  - Press `2` to **exit**
- Once the game starts, it invokes the `Game` class‚Äôs `start()` method to begin the match.
- After each game, the user is asked if they want to play again (`y/n`).
- The loop continues based on user input.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The main game logic (game board, win/tie checking, etc.) should be implemented in the `Game` class.

### Prerequisites

- Java installed (JDK 8 or higher)
